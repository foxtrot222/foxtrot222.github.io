  <h3>Conway's Game Of Life in C</h3>
  <img src="./assets/game_of_life.gif" width="500">
  <p>
    I created <strong>Conway’s Game of Life</strong> in C using the <strong>Ncurses</strong> library. Initially, I thought implementing the neighbor algorithm would be challenging, but as I started coding, it turned out to be much easier than I expected. I realized that sometimes, the key to solving problems is just to dive into the code—especially when thinking through things on paper doesn't help.
  </p>
  <p>
      I first came across Conway's Game of Life in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQX2HjkcNo&pp=ygUXZ2FtZSBvZiBsaWZlIHZlcml0YXNpdW0%3D" target="_blank">Veritasium video</a> and became really interested in it. Later, I got more involved in building my own version after seeing a Reddit post by a user,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lonelyroom-eklaghor" target="_blank">u/lonelyroom-eklaghor</a>, who mentioned that it’s a great programming project for beginners. <a href="https://github.com/foxtrot222/game_of_life" target="_blank">Source Code</a>

  <h3>Old Renders from 2022</h3>

  <p>I started using <a href="https://www.blender.org" target="_blank">Blender</a> in 2021, initially focusing on hard surface modeling. I learned a lot from YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JoshGambrell" target="_blank">Josh Gambrell</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PonteRyuurui" target="_blank">Ponte Ryuui</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ChippWalters" target="_blank">Chipp Walters</a>. Unfortunately, many of my project files and photos are lost, but I managed to recover a few renders from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PerfectCombetEVER" target="_blank">Perfect Comber Ever</a> Discord server, which was pretty active during the lockdown.</p>
  <p>The first image is a 3D model I created based on the drone from the movie <i>Oblivion</i>. The style is similar to Blender Bros, but I hope to develop my own style in the future. The second image is something I made following a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqbE0e2jJIk&pp=0gcJCdQJAYcqIYzv" target="_blank">tutorial</a> by Chipp Walters. It was created using displacement maps, and I thought it turned out really cool. The last image, while not my proudest work, was enhanced by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8M45g73urY" target="_blank">Chipp Walters' SketchStyle add-on</a>, which gave it a unique touch. I took a break from Blender in 2022 to focus on other things.</p>
